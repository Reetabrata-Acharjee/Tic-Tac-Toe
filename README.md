# Tic-Tac-Toe
I'm excited to share my Tic Tac Toe game project, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases my skills in creating interactive and engaging user experiences. The game is designed to be played by two players, to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The project consists of three main components: HTML for structuring the game board and elements, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and game logic. I used HTML to create a 3x3 grid for the game board, with each square represented by a div element. I then used CSS to style the board and squares, adding a responsive design and hover effects.

In JavaScript, I implemented the game logic, including player turns, win conditions, and a restart feature. I used the HTML DOM to manipulate the game elements and update the game state.

This project demonstrates my ability to work with front-end technologies to create engaging and interactive experiences. I'm proud to share it with you, and I hope you enjoy playing the game!
